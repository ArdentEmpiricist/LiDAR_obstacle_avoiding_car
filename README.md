# LiDAR_obstacle_avoiding_car
Adding front-facing LiDAR to the Elegoo Smart Car V3.0 via VL53L0X Sensor

Based on the standard Elegoo Smart Car V3.0, the forward facing ultrasonic sensor is replaced by a forward-facing sweeping LiDAR (from 50째 to 130째). 
If the robot encounters an obstacle (<= 35 cm), it will check the distance at 10째 and 170째 to determine which way to proceed. 

Uses code from Elegoo (www.elegoo.com) and Adafruit (www.adafruit.com).
