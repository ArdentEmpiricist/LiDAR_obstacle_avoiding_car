Adding front-facing LiDAR to the Elegoo Smart Car V3.0 via VL53L0X Sensor

Based on the standard Elegoo Smart Car V3.0, the forward facing ultrasonic sensor is replaced by a forward-facing sweeping LiDAR (from 50째 to 130째). 
If the robot encounters an obstace (<= 35 cm), it will check the disctance to at 10째 and 170째 to determine which way to proceed.
